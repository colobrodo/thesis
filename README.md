# Test Report Thesis

This repo contains my thesis for the computer science courses at unimib written in Latex (in Italian).  
It is a detailed description of my internship project, which I did in DDX. During this time I have developed a test report.
I made a complete web application, developing both the backend and the frontend.  
I developed an API using python and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and that can also be used by other developers to obtain the status of a test suite and modify a specific test case.  
The frontend was developed using the [Angular Framework](https://github.com/angular/angular).  
This tool is currently used in production by the test servers of every development department.  
The project itself is not available.
